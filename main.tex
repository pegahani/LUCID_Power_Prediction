\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Industry and Mechanic}
In this part we would present (@Dmitry: these are just our suggestions, you can write this part better than us):
\begin{itemize}
\item A general paragraph on the industrial context such as the difficulty of generating real data for the industrial section
\item What is the necessity of using simulators (such as NCSIMUL) for the industrial world. 
\item What is he interest/difficulty of adapting the simulated data to the real observed data.
\item A general description on UF1 protocol (May be we should put this part in section 4.1. I am not sure.)
\item related works from the industrial point of view
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed approach}

\subsection{Curves Alignment}
In this section, explain our approach (data preparation + dynamic time wrapping) for aligning two curves and motivation of introducing this measure as a loss function namely $l$(curve1, curve2). 
\subsection{Classical ML methods on adaptive learning}
\subsection{Various neural networks + fine tuning}
\subsection{Learning on simulated Data and adaptation on real Data}

\section{Experimental Setup}
\subsection{GP2R Presentation}
@Dmitry You can present the GP2R here or in another part of the paper if you have a suggestion.
\subsection{Dataset}
In this section we will present the data from Machine Learning point of view. And our setting for neural networks and other machine learning methods.
\begin{itemize}
\item explain all used parameters such as $F, S, A_e, A_p$ and power 
\item Real data set including materials, tools and the power definition of this dataset
\item COM data and its preparation 
\item NCSIMUL data and its power definition
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Experimental Results}

\section{Conclusion and future works}
