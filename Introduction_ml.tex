\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain how existed machine learning methods are effective for reducing the gap between simulated and observed data.
    \item related works on neural networks, fine tuning and domain adaptation.
    \item May be some related works on few shot learning. 
    \item if there exists any, related works on the successful works on reducing the gab between  simulated and real data.
